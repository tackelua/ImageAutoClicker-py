# Auto Clicker with Image Detection

An application that automatically clicks when it finds a matching image on the screen.

## Features

- Select specific screen areas for searching
- Use existing images or crop directly from the screen
- Adjust detection precision (with OpenCV)
- Preview click locations without actually clicking
- Visual feedback with status indicators
- Customizable delay between clicks

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Option 1: Installation with Virtual Environment (Recommended)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tackelua/ImageAutoClicker-py.git
   cd ImageAutoClicker-with-ImageDetection
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Option 2: Direct Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tackelua/ImageAutoClicker-py.git
   cd ImageAutoClicker-with-ImageDetection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install PyQt5 pyautogui Pillow
   ```

3. Optional: Install OpenCV for enhanced image detection:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```
   python auto_clicker.py
   ```
   
   Or use the starter script (which checks dependencies):
   ```
   python starter.py
   ```

2. Select a screen area where the application will search for your target image.

3. Either select an existing image file or crop a new one from the screen.

4. Adjust the settings:
   - Match Precision: Higher for exact matches, lower for more flexible detection (requires OpenCV)
   - Delay: Time in seconds between each search/click
   - Preview Mode: Check to see detection without clicking

5. Click "Start" to begin the automatic detection and clicking.

6. Click "Stop" at any time to stop the process.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Confidence" keyword error**: Install OpenCV with `pip install opencv-python`
- **Image not detected**: Try lowering the precision value or ensuring the screen area is correctly selected
- **Clicking wrong position**: Make sure the cropped image doesn't have borders or background elements

## Credits and License

This project is based on the original work by [Mark Peng (MarkPengJZ)](https://github.com/MarkPengJZ/AutoClicker-with-ImageDetection) with the following improvements:

- Enhanced UI with better visual feedback
- Added support for OpenCV-based image detection with adjustable precision
