# Auto Clicker with Image Detection

An application that automatically clicks when it finds a matching image on the screen.

## Features

- Select specific screen areas for searching
- **Support for multiple target images** - click on whichever is found first
- Use existing images or crop directly from the screen
- Adjust detection precision (with OpenCV)
- Preview click locations without actually clicking
- Return mouse to original position after clicking
- Visual feedback with status indicators
- Customizable delay between clicks
- **Auto-save and restore settings** between sessions

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Option 1: Automatic Installation with Starter Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is to use the starter script, which automatically:
- Creates a virtual environment
- Installs all dependencies
- Ensures all directories are created
- Runs the application

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tackelua/ImageAutoClicker-py.git
   cd ImageAutoClicker-py
   ```

2. Run the starter script:
   ```
   python starter.py
   ```

That's it! The starter script will set up everything automatically.

### Option 2: Manual Installation with Virtual Environment

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tackelua/ImageAutoClicker-py.git
   cd ImageAutoClicker-py
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Option 3: Direct Installation (System Python)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tackelua/ImageAutoClicker-py.git
   cd ImageAutoClicker-py
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install PyQt5 pyautogui Pillow
   ```

3. Optional: Install OpenCV for enhanced image detection:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

## Usage

### Using the Starter Script (Recommended)

Simply run:
```
python starter.py
```

This will set up the environment and start the application automatically.

If you want to use your system Python instead of a virtual environment:
```
python starter.py --no-venv
```

### Running Directly

If you've already set up the environment manually:

1. Run the application:
   ```
   python auto_clicker.py
   ```

2. Select a screen area where the application will search for your target image.

3. **Add one or more target images** either by selecting existing image files or cropping directly from the screen.

4. Adjust the settings:
   - Match Precision: Higher for exact matches (default: 0.8), lower for more flexible detection (requires OpenCV)
   - Delay: Time in seconds between each search/click
   - Preview Mode: Check to see detection without clicking
   - Return Mouse Position: Enable/disable returning mouse to original position after clicking

5. Click "Start" to begin the automatic detection and clicking.

6. Click "Stop" at any time to stop the process.

7. **Your settings and target images will be automatically saved** and restored the next time you run the application.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Confidence" keyword error**: Install OpenCV with `pip install opencv-python`
- **Image not detected**: Try lowering the precision value or ensuring the screen area is correctly selected
- **Clicking wrong position**: Make sure the cropped image doesn't have borders or background elements
